Polaris 2018
=============
Creating a scaffolding for full stack React with TypeScript (striving to put everything in TS), Apollo, GraphQL, Jest, Express, React Router and make them all work cohesively

### Vision
This is a work in progress. Idea is to treat this as scaffolding for future projects.
It will also be a learning of all these technologies in React Ecosystem.

### Technologies to be incorporated
* React 16.3
* TypeScript (Both on client and server side)
* React Router 4
* PostCSS for CSS
* Webpack 4
* Jest (React Testing)
* Apollo
* GraphQL
* Express 
* MongoDB
* Testing for Express (not sure which framework to use)
